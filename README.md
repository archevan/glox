# GLOX üç£

### A _very_ **WIP** Lox interpreter written in Golang

This project is intended (almost) exclusively as a learning project.

## The code is heavily inspired by the Java source code presented in _Crafting Interpreters_

#### usage

Run from file:

```
.\glx.exe [path-to-script]
```

Run the REPL:

```
.\glx.exe
```

#### misc. notes

- The build script(s) in the scripts directory are for windows (sorry!)
- The source is 100% Go so it should be pretty easy to build for other platforms
